# Time-Track

A crazy retro application for the programming and follow-up of appointments, labs (psychotropic dosage), treatments, weight, allergies, for 24 patients. 
A backup is planned for each beginning of the month, and a reminder is programmed in case of treatment interruption or to signal an appointment for the next day (this is of course configurable in open-source). 

Start app with :
> $ python3 time_track.py

Enjoy !
